# esphome-elero

ESPHome component for controlling Elero wireless blinds and lights via an ESP32 with a CC1101, SX1262, or SX1276 868 MHz RF transceiver. Bidirectional -- sends commands and receives status feedback.

Requires **ESPHome 2026.9.0 or newer**. Local development uses Python 3.12;
install the pinned tools with `mise install`, then dependencies with `mise exec -- uv sync`.
Native API devices continue to come from NVS; existing device backups and configuration
remain supported. See [ESPHome compatibility](docs/ESPHOME-COMPATIBILITY.md) for migration details.

## Quick Start

### 1. Choose your hardware

Pick a device config for your board:

- [ESP32 + CC1101](docs/devices/esp32-cc1101.md) -- generic ESP32 with external CC1101 module
- [Heltec WiFi LoRa 32 V4](docs/devices/heltec-lora-v4.md) -- onboard SX1262 (experimental)
- [LILYGO LoRa32 V2.1](docs/devices/lilygo-lora32-sx1276.md) -- onboard SX1276 (experimental)
- [LilyGO T-Embed](docs/devices/lilygo-t-embed.md) -- onboard CC1101

### 2. Choose your output adapter

Devices always live in NVS and are managed at runtime through the web UI. The adapter only decides how Home Assistant sees them:

**`elero_nvs:`** -- ESPHome native API. Recommended for HA-only setups.

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://manuschillerdev/esphome-elero

# ... board + SPI + elero config from your device page ...

api:
elero_nvs:
elero_web:
```

**`elero_mqtt:`** -- MQTT HA discovery. Use when you already run an MQTT broker, or when you want device CRUD to apply without rebooting.

```yaml
external_components:
  - source: github://manuschillerdev/esphome-elero

# ... board + SPI + elero config from your device page ...

mqtt:
  broker: !secret mqtt_broker

elero_mqtt:
  topic_prefix: elero
  discovery_prefix: homeassistant
  device_name: "Elero Gateway"

elero_web:
```

### 3. Flash, discover, and add devices

1. Flash your config (`uv run esphome run your-config.yaml`).
2. Open `http://<device-ip>/elero`.
3. Press buttons on your physical Elero remote -- RF packets appear in real time and remotes/blinds are auto-discovered.
4. Save discovered devices in the web UI.
5. (Optional) **Backup**: Hub → Backup & Restore → Download. Keep this JSON safe -- it's how you recover devices after flashing a replacement chip.

### Migrating from older versions (YAML-defined devices)

If you're upgrading from a version where devices were defined under `cover: - platform: elero` / `light: - platform: elero`, see [docs/MIGRATION-yaml-to-nvs.md](docs/MIGRATION-yaml-to-nvs.md). The TL;DR: run `uv run scripts/migrate_yaml_to_json.py old.yaml -o backup.json`, remove the `cover:` / `light:` blocks from YAML, flash, then upload the backup via the web UI.

### Fork engineering build

The embedded UI is built from local sources with Node and pnpm 10.32.1.
Run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` and `pnpm build` in
`components/elero_web/frontend/app` before compiling firmware.
ESPHome rejects stale or mismatched assets and attempts a local rebuild.
See [engineering checkpoints](docs/RAFFSTORE-ENGINEERING.md) for validation and rollback limitations.
